## ðŸ‘‹ About Me :
    I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer, with a background in physics. I am currently seeking
    new opportunities in Texas or remotely, but I'd be open to discuss any other opportunities out of the area. 
    Understanding and analyzing data is my passion. Using my scientific training, combined with my training in 
    machine learning and artificial intelligence, I strive to solve even the most difficult of problems. I have 
    a strong background in mathematics, research, Python, SQL, APIs, AWS, Docker, and experience in Java. My past 
    experience in research has given me the tools I need to better understand problems, through first-principles 
    thinking, and has given me the skills to succinctly deliver and communicate my results to large groups of 
    people. I also have many years in the communications industry, and this has given me the confidence and 
    know-how to communicate effectively one-on-one.

## ðŸ”­ Current Project(s):
    I am currently working on one of the National Health Institute's private datasets on the subject of cancer. 
    The study will attempt to determine whether it is possible to determine probability of a cancer diagnosis based 
    on available health questionaires and/or non-invasive health screenings.

## ðŸ‘¯ I'm willing to collaborate on:
    Any project which requires data science.
